## Future Improvements
There is a lot of room for improvement in `GearSet`s and generator examples. A new `GearSetGenerator` class or similar could be powerful.

Rack and pinion - could be infinite or set length. If finite length, would likely need to limit a `GearSet`s rotation. Could be used for effects such as having a rack as the side of a `<div>` to make it appear as though the gear is moving the `<div>`.
